# COMP-432 Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image classification tasks in the context of medical applications. For part 1 of the project, the goal is to train and evaluate CNN models on a dataset consisting of Colorectal Cancer Images (MUS, NORM, STR).

## Requirements
The code was run in the google colab application. Can be run in a python IDE or Jupyter but need to use custom path to the dataset folders.
- The following libraries are required to run the code:
    - os
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - sklearn
    - torch
    - torchvision

## Instructions on how to train/validate the model

## Instructions on how to run pre-trained model on sample dataset
